When humanity was in its prime [[Heat]] was abundant. Heat spweud from every organic life form and all engines were feed heartily. Humans created Machines, intelligent life that ran on artificial heat, to assist in automating their lives and productions. But, as heat does, it dissipated. Humanity started to stutter, there wasn’t enough heat to go around and people would grow weak and die. Empires crumbled with not enough heat to sustain themselves and people became more spread out than ever in attempts to keep their heat to themselves. 

In current day, robots have come to coincide with their creators, in fact some would say they’ve surpassed them. Some of the remaining humans have grown a despise for robots and the way they’ve been able to survive despite the heat decline; some people have grow so hateful towards robots that they have begun to shame and kill them. 

These occurrences have stirred unrest between many robots and people, so much so that its seen almost everywhere even in heavily shared spaces. 

  

From a human group a new ideology has emerged: Humans will die out if they remain the way they are, so they must change. These extremists have begun to secretly try to combine organ life and robot parts to create a cursed amalgamation of agony and suffering. These beings suffer from both species downfall: unable to consume organic heat or burn and make artificial heat. The extremist group is still trying and they are slowly taking over the empty seat of power because of it.

  

In a cavern, far into the mountains, there is a man long thought dead. To have died of cold, and lost all his heat. This is incorrect. He has found a way to survive without any heat, and he is unsure of humanity’s worth to know how to survive.**
