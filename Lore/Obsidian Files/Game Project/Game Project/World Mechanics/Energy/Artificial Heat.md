Artificial Heat is one of the [[Types of Energy]], sharing the ability with [[Heat]] to create energy; although Artificial Heat is made from burning organic material and is not derived from [[Karna Substance]]. Artificial Heat is used to power machinery and [[Machines]], it does not generate energy as long or as powerful as Heat but is renewable as long as there is substance to burn. Artificial Heat is best described as a periodic burst of energy that sputters out as fast as it was lit, as least in comparison to Heat.

**Shared Heat

Heat sharing is a process where [[Engines And Organic Life]] can use Artificial Heat as a way to heal and repair their bodies. This process is only available to Engines because of their specific type of Heat flow. Engines take in Heat through an outward -> inward flow; Artificial Life take in Heat through the opposite flow and thus Machines cannot take in Karnic Heat as a way to heal. 

## History

Human is not used to using Artificial Heat, because although technically an ancient form of energy its also seen as primitive. Its was deemed for many years that Heat was simply a better source of energy and Artificial Heat a useless secondary source better fit for Machines. 

Recently however, Humanity has found a need for Artificial Heat as a means to lengthen their survivability. The rise in need for [[machinery]] that runs off Artificial Heat, and the lack of its availability, has caused Humanity to digress into a less technologically advanced society. Gone are the days where homeowners could walk up to their oven and turn it on using their own Heat, now that meaningless use of Heat is frowned upon.
