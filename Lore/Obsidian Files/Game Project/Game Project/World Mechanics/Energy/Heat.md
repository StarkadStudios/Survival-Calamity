Heat is one of the [[Types of Energy]], and powers all [[Engines And Organic Life]], unlike [[Machines]] who are powered by [[Artificial Heat]]. Heat makes up the majority of a person's being and most of ones actions require using or at least having Heat. The more Heat in a singular organism the more powerful that organism is seen to be, although everything exerts heat differently. 

Heat cannot be passed on through any means that are not physically painful. When an organism dies, it leaves a portion of its Heat behind and the rest of its Heat is sent into the [[Energy Reliquary]] and it's existence is considered [[COLD]]. If a separate organism is nearby, it will often absorb the heat of the organism, increasing its own [[Heat Capacity]]. 

Burning organic material will produce an Artificial Heat source, the type of energy that powers Artificial Life. While not able to increase Heat Capacity, this type of [[Heat Source]] can heal Organic Life through sharing of Heat (see [[Artificial Heat]] for more info). 


### History

Previously thought to be an unlimited source of energy, Heat was used to power all of humanity during [[Humanity's Prime]]. Heat is believed to have existed since the conception of the universe, or at least the creation of [[Lellia]]. 

Dissipation of Heat since humanity's prime has slowed but is still very much a threat to everyone's existence. Its theorized the dissipation of Heat was so extreme during humanity's prime because of extensive use of heat to power the [[Domains of Humanity]]. 

**Usage as a Power Source**

As mentioned previously, Heat is and was the main source of humanity. General [[machinery]] was originally chosen to be powered by Heat because Heat is much stronger lasts longer than Artificial Heat. Now in current day, Heat is rarely used as power, instead people have resorted to the slower and inaccurate method of Artificial Heat. 

**Origins

Heat was created through [[Karna Substance]], one of two existing sources of power which is placed in planets meant to harbor life. Karna substance makes up planets' core.

No one knows what Karna substance actually is, and thus there is no way to make more Karna substance. The substance, when in mass groups of itself appears as an ethereal white liquid, but in smaller instances solidifies and becomes darker; commonly going through color phases of: white, yellow, red, brown, and black, black being a very small amount. The [[Karnic Sample]] that appears with the game's protagonist take on this final color phase of solid black rock.
